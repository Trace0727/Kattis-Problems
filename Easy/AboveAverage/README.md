# AboveAverageCalculator

A concise Java console application that reads multiple test cases, computes each class’s average score, and prints the percentage of students who scored above that average—perfect practice for loops, arrays, input parsing, and formatted output.
This problem is inspired by the classic Kattis challenge: [AboveAverage](https://open.kattis.com/problems/aboveaverage).

## Core Java Class

### `AboveAverage.java`
Handles the full program workflow:

- Prompts for the **number of test cases**.  
- For each test case:  
  1. Reads the **class size** and all **grades** on a single line.  
  2. Calculates the class average.  
  3. Counts how many grades exceed that average.  
  4. Prints the result as a **percentage with three-decimal precision** (e.g., `57.143%`).  
- Uses a single `Scanner` for all console input and closes it gracefully.

## How to Compile & Run

### From any IDE  
Import the project folder, mark `src/` as the source root, then run `AboveAverage.java`.

### From the command line  
```bash
# Compile
javac src/AboveAverage.java

# Run (class path set to src)
java -cp src AboveAverage
```

Follow on-screen prompts: first enter the number of test cases, then enter each class’s size and its grades on one line.
